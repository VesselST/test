                <p>Mr. Chi Wen-Hao’s mother once told him, “A few grains of rice won't help when you're in trouble.” Years later, this phrase became his support when facing the lows of life. Just as he was seeking a new path, his brother’s friend Chen Ting-Hui proactively suggested a collaboration. While Chen had rubber technology and equipment, he lacked orders and business capability. The two quickly clicked and decided to enter the then-popular roller skating shoe parts market, leading to the establishment of the new company "WEVER".</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <p>Through actively visiting shoe factories and accurately assessing market demand, orders for brake heads and parts quickly surged, making WEVER a major supplier. To capture higher added value, Mr. Chi Wen-Hao further invested in the assembly of finished ice skates but encountered a sudden downturn in the market, as European trends rapidly faded and orders plummeted. Confronted with reality, he decisively downsized and adjusted manpower to withstand the slump at minimal cost.</p>

                <p>Targeting the domestic market, he established his own brand "Citroen," insisting on quality and pricing without resorting to price-cutting competition. By utilizing consignment methods to rapidly distribute products, he increased visibility and quickly built a sales network across Taiwan, successfully opening up the market and restoring the team’s confidence.</p>
                <p>After stabilizing his business, due to the deteriorating production environment in Taiwan, he decided to set up a factory in mainland China. After exploring and undergoing negotiations and risk assessments, he ultimately established a factory in Shenzhen and set up a base in the United States, completing his overseas layout. This growth journey was accompanied by family separation and health alerts; the price was heavy, but it also reinforced his belief that only by continuing to move forward in changing times could he truly carve out his own path.</p>

                <p><strong>With precise marketing strategies and a commitment to quality, "Citroen" ice skates gained fame in Taiwan's domestic market, propelling Mr. Chi Wen-Hao's career into a period of remarkable growth. However, in the late 1980s, Taiwan's society suffered from a gambling frenzy with "Big Lotto," which led to a deteriorating production environment, escalating labor shortages and management issues that forced him to consider long-term survival strategies for his business. To reduce production risks and secure core resources, he decisively decided to shift production capacity to mainland China, completing a significant transition in business operations and overseas layout by establishing a manufacturing base in Shenzhen and actively developing the American market.</strong></p>
