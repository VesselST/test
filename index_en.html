        <h1>Overview</h1>
        
        <section id="introduction">
            <p>The protagonist of this website is <strong>Chi Wen-Hao</strong>. He is the president of <strong>WEVER Group</strong>.</p>
            <p>In 1974, he founded the company from scratch, starting with manufacturing metal and plastic products for Taiwan’s domestic electronics industry. Currently, his WEVER Group is a multinational corporation specializing in OEM manufacturing of water-sports equipment, pet accessories, and extreme-sports gear, and some of its products hold the largest market share worldwide. Currently, his business has a global presence, with investment companies in the United States and Australia, and distributors in various European countries selling nearly a thousand products. In 2003, he integrated all subsidiaries to establish WEVER Group and established its headquarters in Tamsui.</p>

            <div class="image-frame">
                <img src="images/home_01.jpg" alt="Mr. Chi Wen-Hao">
                <p class="caption">Mr. Chi Wen-Hao</p>
            </div>

            <p>Chi Wen-Hao’s career has been marked by struggle, setbacks, and hard-won progress. He was born into a wealthy family in Dadaocheng. His family fell into decline when he was in elementary school and he experienced hardship. After completing his military service, he started from the bottom. His entrepreneurial journey was full of ups and downs and obstacles. He encountered two oil crises as soon as he started his business. He used his unparalleled perseverance to cope with the situation by innovating products, changing structures, and strengthening research and development.</p>
            
            <p>After that, the financial crisis, the bubble economy, SARS, and COVID-19 all passed. It is an epitome of the struggle history of Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises during Taiwan's economic take-off in the last century. It also became a model for Taiwanese businesses expanding into mainland China.</p>

            <p>Chi Wen-Hao remains mindful of those who supported him along the way. He serves as President of Taiwan’s oldest golf club and as Chair of the Tamkang High School Alumni Association. This webpage is a report by Tamkang High School students on the legendary life of their alumnus, in order to record the changes in Taiwanese society and his expectations for young people today.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="motivation" class="motivation-box">
            <p>For high school students, Chi Wen-Hao's struggle history is not merely a slogan from “success culture”, but a learning model that can be compared with their own situation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First</strong>, when facing setbacks, they can transform pressure into discipline and more accurate judgment;</li>
                <li><strong>Second</strong>, in interpersonal relationships and cooperation, they can accumulate long-term credit with sincerity and trust;</li>
                <li><strong>Third</strong>, they can build leadership with service and altruism, and use the principles of <em>"Be able to yield, be able to endure, be able to teach, be able to wait"</em> to deal with conflicts and uncertain situations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These abilities correspond to the "resilience, communication, and risk thinking" that high school students need most under the pressure of further education, competitions, clubs, and interpersonal relationships.</p>

                <p class="caption">Chi Wen-Hao's motto</p>
            </div>

            <p>Because he currently serves as Chair of the Tamkang High School Alumni Association, we have opportunities to meet him on campus and are willing to learn more from him. So we formed a team to record his experience through reading his autobiography and conducting interviews, and organized it into a clear growth path, divided into personal life, family, career achievements, and values and character, hoping that readers can more systematically understand how he adjusts his pace and accumulates abilities under realistic pressure, and transforms each setback into a starting point for a new departure.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="process">
            <h2>The Process of Project Production</h2>
            <div class="image-frame">
                <img src="images/home_03.jpg" alt="Students visit Chi Wen-Hao">
                <p class="caption">Senior High School Students Visit Chi Wen-Hao</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="process-step">
                <p>Throughout the entire website and project production process, we went through a very long process from the initial division of labor and planning to the subsequent interviews, organization, and planning. Although there are many complex things to do each time we do a project, everyone can be very efficient in the layout and planning of the website during the actual production.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Everyone did a very good job in their respective assigned tasks. This time, the organization of Chairman Chi Wen-Hao's life mainly focuses on his childhood business process and personal autobiography content; the follow-up interview focuses on supplementing the parts that are not yet recorded in the current autobiography. Through multiple interviews, we not only pieced together the story context more completely, but also gained a deeper understanding of Chairman Chi Wen-Hao's business philosophy in various aspects; whether it is the industry he is currently engaged in, or the bits and pieces of serving as the chairman of the alumni association, we have a deeper understanding of him in these interviews.</p>

            <div class="image-frame">

                <p class="caption">Senior High School Students Visit Chi Wen-Hao</p>
            </div>

            <p>We hope that through participating in the International Schools CyberFair, more people can learn about the life of Chairman Chi Wen-Hao, and we also invite you to read and think with us - <strong>when reality is not as expected, can we be like Chi Wen-Hao and turn every fall into the starting point for the next stand up?</strong></p>
