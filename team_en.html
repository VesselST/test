            <span class="member-name">李鵬成 Li Peng-Cheng</span>
            <p>When I took Mr. Su Wen-Kui’s elective course for the first time, I learned about the International Schools CyberFair competition. We would need to build a website, which felt quite challenging. After careful discussion, we decided to participate. Although I did not contribute much to the website-building side, I was able to help with collecting information and writing part of the website content. On several occasions, we visited Chi Wen-Hao, the President of the Alumni Association. Through the interviews, I learned some basic reporting principles—for example, you must be clear about the topic, think through what questions to ask in advance, anticipate how the other person might respond, and, if the response is different from what you expected, adapt on the spot. That process also included some fun and unexpected moments. The chairman also shared a line with us: “Be able to yield, be able to endure, be able to teach, be able to wait” emphasizing perseverance, tolerance, and communication—exactly the life experience I still lack. This was an unprecedented competition experience for me. If I have the chance to participate again, I would like to do it again.</p>

            <p>Being able to take part in the “International Schools CyberFair” was truly special. I am also very grateful for the support of our advising teacher, Mr. Su, who helped us organize and preserve Mr. Chi Wen-Hao’s story in a complete way. During our research, we explored Tamsui’s past together through Mr. Chi’s experiences and found that it differs greatly from the present. This made us realize how important it is to document history. From organizing materials to conducting interviews and discussing the website, every step required teamwork, and I learned new skills and methods along the way. I hope that through our website, everyone can not only get to know Mr. Chi Wen-Hao, but also feel the warmth and human touch of Tamsui.</p>

            <p>In this project, I served as the team leader. I was responsible for organizing materials, editing videos, adjusting the website, and managing the overall schedule.

            <p>In the International Schools CyberFair project, I was responsible for photography.

            <p>I am very pleased to participate in this Web Expo. I am especially grateful to Mr. Su for trusting us and giving us the opportunity to take over, continue the theme from the previous session, and keep producing a special feature about Mr. Ji Wenhao, the president of the Tamkang Alumni Association. Before this event, I actually knew nothing about President Ji; but through this in-depth research, I not only learned about his remarkable life but was also deeply moved by his philosophy on life.</p>

            <p>In this International Schools CyberFair project, I served as an editor. From Chairman Chi Wen-Hao, we learned many practical attitudes and approaches for navigating society and handling relationships. I plan to turn what he shared—his experiences and lessons—into a documentary through editing. At the same time, I learned a great deal about how to communicate more effectively with my teammates. Together, we successfully completed this project.</p>

            <span class="member-name">蔣維珉 Jiang Wei-Wen</span>
            <p>I am very happy to participate in the CyberFair again this year. We chose the “big boss,” Chairman Chi Wen-Hao, as our research subject because his influence in industry and his decision-making mindset have profoundly shaped the direction of society and the economy. Through collecting and organizing information, we hope to understand the journey, values, and management philosophy behind his success. More importantly, we want to learn from his perspective and attitude when facing challenges, so that this research becomes not just a competition entry, but also an important process of personal growth and expanding our horizons.</p>

            <p>This was my first time participating in the CyberFair, and I was responsible for website production. Through the competition, I learned many stories about Chairman Chi Wen-Hao—his life and many interesting experiences—and I also improved my technical skills in building a website.</p>

            <p>When I first heard about the CyberFair competition, I could not help imagining the mysteries of the online world. During the process, we interviewed Chairman Chi Wen-Hao and listened as he described his life experiences. Indirectly, I came to understand the ups and downs of life, as well as its unique joys. This opportunity also gave me a different perspective. I now cherish more deeply what I see in daily life and the people I care about, and I am creating memories that belong to my own “life record.”</p>

            <span class="member-name">黃苡瑄 Huang Yi-Hsuan</span>
            <p>In this CyberFair project, I was responsible for organizing Chairman Chi Wen-Hao’s personal character strengths and his motto. I was deeply inspired by his motto: “Be able to yield, be able to endure, be able to teach, be able to wait.” This wisdom, which transcends generations, is not only the core reason he can move smoothly between leadership roles in both the alumni association and the business world; it also aligns closely with his brand philosophy and life beliefs, becoming a model of conduct worth learning from for younger generations. Through this research, I have come to understand that the key to success lies in holding firmly to one’s principles and remaining composed in difficult circumstances. With gratitude and insight, I will translate what I learned into concrete actions and contribute to our team.</p>
